PhyloGene
PhyloGene is a bioinformatics tool designed to analyze and visualize phylogenetic relationships among genes. This tool enables researchers to explore evolutionary patterns and generate phylogenetic trees, providing insights into the evolutionary history of different gene sequences.

Features
Phylogenetic Analysis: Perform detailed phylogenetic analysis of gene sequences to uncover evolutionary relationships.
Tree Visualization: Generate and customize phylogenetic trees for easy interpretation and presentation.
Sequence Alignment: Integrate with popular sequence alignment tools to ensure accurate phylogenetic inference.
Data Import/Export: Support for importing gene sequence data in various formats and exporting results for further analysis.
Installation
To install PhyloGene, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/EduardoRamonHernandez/PhyloGene.git
cd PhyloGene
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run PhyloGene, follow these steps:

Prepare your gene sequence data in the supported format.
Use the command-line interface or the provided GUI to load your data.
Perform sequence alignment (if necessary) and generate a phylogenetic tree.
Customize and export the tree for further analysis or publication.
bash
Copy code
python phylogene.py --input your_data.fasta --output tree_output.png
